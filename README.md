# Customer Segmentation using K-Means in Python

_"Segment your customers for better marketing"_ - A quote from the Internet





### Relevant Notes

Imagine you run a T-shirt business. You sell T-shirts in different sizes (Small, Medium, Large, XL), colors (red, blue, black, white), and styles (round neck, V-neck, long sleeve, short sleeve). However, not all customers are interested in every option.

##### 1. Demographic Segmentation

Customers might be divided by age, gender, or income. Younger customers might prefer trendy designs like graphic T-shirts, while older customers might prefer plain or classic styles.

##### 2. Geographic Segmentation

If you sell in colder regions, long-sleeve T-shirts might be more popular, while in warmer areas, short sleeves would be in demand.

##### 3. Psychographic Segmentation

Some customers might prefer eco-friendly, organic cotton T-shirts, while others might be more interested in brand names or unique designs that express their personality.

##### 4. Behavioral Segmentation

You might notice that customers who have purchased black T-shirts in the past are more likely to buy black again. Or, customers who bought a sports-themed T-shirt might be interested in similar athletic wear.
By using segmentation, you can target specific groups with T-shirt designs, marketing messages, and offers tailored to their preferences, making your business more efficient and your customers happier.


### Business Scenario
Suppose we are working as a data scientist for a FMCG company and want to segment our customers to help the marketing department for them to launch new products and sales based on the segmentation. Therefore we will save our time and money by marketing a specific group of customers with selected products.

##### How Did we collect the data by the way?

All data has been collected through the loyalty cards they use at checkout.

We will utilize K-Means and PCA algorithms for this project and see how we define new grouped customers.
