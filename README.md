# Customer Segmentation using K-Means in Python

_"Segment your customers for better marketing"_ - A quote from the Internet


### Relevant Notes

Imagine you run a T-shirt business. You sell T-shirts in different sizes (Small, Medium, Large, XL), colors (red, blue, black, white), and styles (round neck, V-neck, long sleeve, short sleeve). However, not all customers are interested in every option.

##### 1. Demographic Segmentation

Customers might be divided by age, gender, or income. Younger customers might prefer trendy designs like graphic T-shirts, while older customers might prefer plain or classic styles.

##### 2. Geographic Segmentation

If you sell in colder regions, long-sleeve T-shirts might be more popular, while in warmer areas, short sleeves would be in demand.

##### 3. Psychographic Segmentation

Some customers might prefer eco-friendly, organic cotton T-shirts, while others might be more interested in brand names or unique designs that express their personality.

##### 4. Behavioral Segmentation

You might notice that customers who have purchased black T-shirts in the past are more likely to buy black again. Or, customers who bought a sports-themed T-shirt might be interested in similar athletic wear.
By using segmentation, you can target specific groups with T-shirt designs, marketing messages, and offers tailored to their preferences, making your business more efficient and your customers happier.
